MCMC_data
=========

The data contained in the NGRIP.gz and NEEM.gz archives was
derived from the original proxy data in the **ramp_data**
directory by application of the software provided by Tobias
Erhardt. The archives contain 6000 samples from the joint
Bayesian posterior distributions for the six parameters of a
linear ramp model for all transition time series available in the
**ramp_data** directory.
