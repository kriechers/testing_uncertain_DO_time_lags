=========

This directory contains short time series of the proxies

* Na+ [ng/g]
* Ca2+ [ng/g]
* d18o [per mil] (NGRIP only)
* annual layer thickness [m] (NGRIP only)

centered around the Greenland warming events indicated in the
file **GIS_table.txt**. The first column of each file indicates
the time with respect to the time of the corresponding warming
event, with negative time being prior to the event.
The second column indicates the data value. For Ca2+, Na+ and
annual layer thickness the logarithm of the original data value
is given.
